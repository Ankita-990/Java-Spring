# Java Spring
# This repository has some basic examples of Java Spring applications, which I have performed in my Internship period as a Java Intern
# In this I've worked of Database connection, Spring Data JPA, REST API, and JSP pages
# This repo is best for who are good in Java programming and ready to work on some real-time projects
